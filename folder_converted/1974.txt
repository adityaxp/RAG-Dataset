118. Discharge of person informed against. —If, on an inquiry under section 116, it is not prov ed that it is 
necessary for keeping the peace or maintaining good behaviour, as the case may be, that the person in respect of 
whom the inquiry is made, should execute a bond, the Magistrate shall make an entry on the record to that effect, 
and if such per son is in custody only for the purposes of the inquiry, shall release him, or, if such person is not in 
custody, shall discharge him.  
119. Commencement of period for which security is required. —(1) If any person, in respect of whom an

expiration of such sentence.  
(2) In other cases s uch period shall commence on the date of such order unless the Magistrate, for sufficient 
reason, fixes a later date.  
120. Contents of bond. —The bond to be executed by any such person shall bind him to keep the peace or to be

121. Power to reject sureties. —(1) A Magistrate may refuse to accept a ny surety offered, or may reject any 
surety previously accepted by him or his predecessor under this Chapter on the ground that such surety is an unfit 
person for the purposes of the bond:

on oath into the fitness of the surety, or cause such inquiry to be held and a report to be made thereon by a 
Magistrate subordinate to him.  
(2) Such Magistrate shall, before holding the inquiry, give reasonab le notice to the surety and to the person by

Magistrate deputed under sub -section (1), and the report of such Magistrate (if any), that the surety is an unfit person 
for the purposes of the bond, he shall make an order refusing to accept or rejecting, as the case may be, such surety 
and recording his reasons for so doing:  58 
 Provided that, before making an order rejecting any surety who has previously been accepted, the Magistrate

in pursuance of an order of a Magistrate under section 117, is proved, to the satisfaction of such Magistr ate or his 
successor -in-office, to have committed breach of the bond, such Magistrate or successor -in-office may, after 
recording the grounds of such proof, order that the person be arrested and detained in prison until the expiry of the 
period of the bond  and such order shall be without prejudice to any other punishment or forfeiture to which the said 
person may be liable in accordance with law.  
(2) When such person has been ordered by a Magistrate to give security for a period exceeding one year, such 
Magistrate shall, if such person does not give such security as aforesaid, issue a warrant directing him to be detained 
in prison pending the orders of the Sessions Judge and the proceedings shall be laid, as soon as conveniently may be, 
before such Court.  
(3) Such Court, after examining such proceedings and requiring from the Magistrate any further information or 
evidence which it thinks necessary, and after giving the concerned person a reasonable opportunity of being heard, 
may pass such order on the case a s it thinks fit:  
Provided that the period (if any) for which any person is imprisoned for failure to give security shall not exceed 
three years.  
(4) If security has been required in the course of the same proceeding from two or more persons in respect                  
of any one of whom the proceedings are referred to the Sessions Judge under sub -section (2) such reference shall 
also include the case of any other of such persons who has been order to give security, and the provisions of                  
sub-sections (2) and (3) shall, in that event, apply to the case of such other person also, except that the period (if 
any) for which he may be imprisoned, shall not exceed the period for which he was ordered to give security.  
(5) A Sessions Judge may in his d iscretion transfer any proceedings laid before him under sub -section (2) or 
sub-section (4) to an Additional Sessions Judge or Assistant Sessions Judge and upon such transfer, such Additional 
Sessions Judge or Assistant Sessions Judge may exercise the powe rs of a Sessions Judge under this section in 
respect of such proceedings.  
(6) If the security is tendered to the officer in charge of the jail, he shall forthwith refer the matter to the Court 
or Magistrate who made the order, and shall await the orders of  such Court or Magistrate.

required.

any conditions which such person accepts:  
Provided that any condition imposed shall cease to be operative when the period f or which such person was 
ordered to give security has expired.  
(4) The State Government may prescribe the conditions upon which a conditional discharge may be made.  
(5) If any condition upon which any person has been discharged is, in the opinion of 1[Dist rict Magistrate, in the 
case of an order passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial Magistrate in any other 
case] by whom the order of discharge was made or of his successor, not fulfilled, he may cancel the same.

arrested by any police officer without warrant, and shall thereupon be produced before  the 1[District Magistrate, in 
the case of an order passed by an Executive Ma gistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial Magistrate in any 
other case].  
(7) Unless such person gives security in accordance with the terms of the original order for the unexpired 
portion of the term for which he was in the first instance committed   or ordered to be detained (such portion being 
deemed to be a period equal to the period between the date of the breach  of the conditions of discharge and the date 
on which, except for such conditional discharge, he would have been entitled to release), 1[District Magistrate, in the 
case of an order  passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial Magistrate in any other 
case] may remand such person to prison to undergo such unexpired portion.  
(8) A person remanded to prison unde r sub -section (7) shall, subject to the provisions of section 122, be

1[Distri ct Magistrate, in the case of an order passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief 
Judicial Magistrate in any other case] may make such cancellation where such bond was executed under his order or 
under the order of any other Court in  his district.  
(10) Any surety for the peaceable conduct or good behaviour of another person ordered to execute a bond under 
this Chapter may at any time apply to the Court making such order to cancel the bond and on such application being

description as the original security.  
(2) Every such order shall, for the purposes of sections 120 to 123 (both inclusive) be deemed to be an order 
made under section 106 or sec tion 117, as the case may be.

public peace, to disperse; and it shall thereupon be the duty of the members of such assembly to disperse 
accordingly.  
(2) If, upon being so commanded, any such assembly does not disperse, or if, without be ing so commanded, it

conferred by sub -section (1) in relation to any offence which is compoundable under section 320 or any 
offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or with fine, or with both where 
the Magistrate is of opinion that, hav ing regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, the imposition of

free of cost, a copy of each of the following :—

clause  (iii) and considering the reasons given by the police officer for the request, direct that a copy of that 
part of the statement or of such portion thereof as the Magistrate thinks proper, shall be furnis hed to the 
accused:  
Provided further that if the Magistrate is satisfied that any document referred to in clause (v) is 
voluminous, he shall, instead of furnishing the accused with a copy thereof, direct that he will only be allowed 
to inspect it either pe rsonally or through pleader in Court.  
208. Supply of copies of statements and documents to accused in other cases triable by Court of 
Session. —Where, in a case instituted otherwise than on a police report, it appears to the Magistrate issuing

without delay furnish to the accused, free of cost, a copy of each of the following: — 
(i) the statements recorded under section 200 or section 202, of all pe rsons examined by the

CHAPTER XVII  
THE CHARGE  
A.—Form of charges  
211. Contents of charge. —(1) Every charge under this Code shall state the offence with which the 
accuse d is charged.  
 (2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any specific name, the offence may be described in 
the charge by that name only.  
(3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it any specific name, so much of the definition 
of the offence must be stated as to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.  
(4) The law and section of the law against which the offence is said to have been committed shall be 
mentioned in the charge.  
                                                 
1. Subs. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 19, for cl. ( a)  (w.e.f. 18.12.1978).  91 
 (5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every legal condition required by law to 
constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case.  
(6) The charge shall be written in the language of the Court.  
(7) If the accused, having been previously convict ed of any offence, is liable, by reason of such previous 
conviction, to enhanced punishment, or to punishment of a different kind, for a subsequent offence, and it is 
intended to prove such previous conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment wh ich the Court may think 
fit to award for the subsequent offence, the fact, date and place of the previous conviction shall be stated in the 
charge; and if such statement has been omitted, the Court may add it at any time before sentence is passed.  
Illustra tions  
(a) A is charged with the murder of B. This is equivalent to a statement that A's act fell within the definition of murder 
given in sections 299 and 300 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860); that it did not fall within any of the general exception s 
of the said Code; and that it did not fall within any of the five exceptions to section 300, or that, if it did fall within 
Exception 1, one or other of the three provis os to that exception applied to it.  
(b) A is charged under section 326 of the Indian Pe nal Code (45 of 1860), with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to B 
by means of an instrument for shooting. This is equivalent to a statement that the case was not provided for by section 335 
of the said Code, and that the general exceptions did not apply t o it. 
(c) A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, adultery or criminal intimidation, or using a false property -mark. 
The charge may state that A committed murder, or cheating, or theft, or extortion, or adultery, or criminal intimidation, or 
that he used a false property -mark, without reference to the definition s, of those crimes contained in the Indian Penal Code 
(45 of 1860); but the sections under which the offence is punishable must, in each instance  be referred to in the charge.  
(d) A is c harged under section 184 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) with intentionally obstructing a sale of 
property offered for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant. The charge should be in those words.  
212. Particulars as to time, place and perso n.—(1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time 
and place of the alleged offence, and the person (if any) against whom, or the thing (if any) in respect of which, it 
was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.  
(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of money or other 
movable property, it shall be sufficient to specify the gross sum or, as the case may be, describe the movabl e 
property in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and the dates between which the offence 
is alleged to have been committed, without specifying particular items or exact dates, and the charge so framed shall 
be deemed to be a ch arge of one offence within the meaning of section 219:  
Provided that the time included between the first and last of such dates shall not exceed one year.  
213. When manner of committing offence must be stated. —When the nature of the case is such that the 
particulars mentioned in sections 211 and 212 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he 
is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed 
as will be sufficient for  that purpose.  
Illustrations  
(a) A is accused of the theft of a certain article at a certain time and place. The charge need not set out the manner in 
which the theft was effected.  
(b) A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place. The charge must s et out the manner in which A cheated B.  
 (c) A is accused of giving false evidence at a given time and place. The charge must set out that portion of the 
evidence given by A which is alleged to be false.  92 
 (d) A is accused of obstructing B, a public servant,  in the discharge of his public functions at a given time and place. 
The charge must set out the manner in which A obstructed B in the discharge of his functions.  
(e) A is accused of the murder of B at a given time and place. The charge need not state the manner in which A 
murdered B.  
(f) A is accused of disobeying a direction of the law with intent to save B from punishment. The charge must set out the 
disobedience charged and the law infringed.  
214. Words in charge taken in sense of law under which offenc e is punishable. —In every charge words 
used in describing an offence shall be deemed to have been used in the sense attached to them respectively by the 
law under which such offence is punishable.  
215. Effect of errors. — No error in stating either the offe nce or the particulars required to be stated in the 
charge, and no omission to state the offence or those particulars, shall be regarded at any  stage of the case as 
material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission, and it has occa sioned a failure of justice.  
Illustrations  
(a) A is charged under section 242 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with "having been in possession of 
counterfeit coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that  such coin was counterfe it,” the word 
"fraudulently" being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission, the error shall not  
be regarded as material.  
(b) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in th e charge or is set out 
incorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this 
that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material.  
(c) A is charged with cheating B, an d the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge. There were many 
transactions between A and B, and A had no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no 
defence. The Court may infer from such facts that the omission  to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a 
material error.  
(d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 1882. In fact, the murdered person's name was 
Haidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 188 2. A was never charged with any murder but one, and 
had heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer 
from these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immate rial. 
(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him 
for that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of 
Khoda Baksh. The  witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from 
this that A was misled, and that the error was material.  
216. Court may alter charge .—(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before jud gment is 
pronounced.  
(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused.  
(3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is not likely, in the 
opinion of the Court, to prejudice  the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct of the case, the Court 
may, in its discretion, after such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with the trial as if the altered or added 
charge had been the original charge.  
(4) If the a lteration or addition is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the opinion of the 
Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a new trial or adjourn the 
trial for such period as may be  necessary.  
(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous sanction is 
necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction has been already 
obtained for a p rosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered or added charge is founded.  93 
 217. Recall of witnesses when charge altered. —Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the Court after 
the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused s hall be allowed — 
(a) to recall or re -summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness who may 
have been examined, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, considers that the prosecutor or the 
accused, as the ca se may be, desires to recall or re -examine such witness for the purpose of vexation or delay or 
for defeating the ends of justice;  
(b) also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material.  
B.—Joinder of charges  
218. Separate charges for  distinct offences. —(1) For every distinct offence of which any person is accused 
there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately:  
Provided that where the accused person, by an application in writing, so desires and the Ma gistrate is of opinion 
that such person is not likely to be prejudiced thereby, the Magistrate may try together all or any number of the 
charges framed against such person.  
(2) Nothing in sub -section (1) shall affect the operation of the provisions of sect ions 219, 220, 221 and 223.  
Illustration  
A is accused of a theft on one occasion, and of causing grievous hurt on another occasion. A must be separately charged and 
separately tried for the theft and causing grievous hurt.  
219. Three offences of same kind within year may be charged together. —(1) When a person is accused of 
more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from the first to the last of 
such offences, whether in respect of the same person or not, he may be ch arged with, and tried at one trial for, any 
number of them not exceeding three.  
(2) Offences are of the same kind when they are punishable with the same amount of punishment under the 
same section of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or of any special or local law:  
Provided that, for the purposes of this section, an offence punishable under section 379 of the Indian Penal Code 
(45 of 1860) shall be deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an offence punishable under section 380 of the 
said Code, and tha t an offence punishable under any section of the said Code, or of any special or local law, shall be 
deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an attempt to commit such offence, when such an attempt is an offence.  
220. Trial for more than one offence. —(1) If, in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same

Session, unless the Magistrate is competent to try the case and is of opinion that he can himself pass an adequate 
sentence if the accused is convicted.  
 (2) When any person is  sent for trial to the Chief Judicial Magistrate or committed to the Court of Session 
under sub -section (1), any other person accused jointly with him in the same inquiry or trial shall be similarly sent or 
committed, unless the Magistrate discharges such other person under section 239 or section 245, as the case may be.  
325. Procedure when Magistrate cannot pass sentence sufficiently severe. —(1) Whenever a Magistrate is of 
opinion, after hearing the evidence for the prosecution and the accused, that the ac cused is guilty, and that he ought 
to receive a punishment different in kind from, or more severe than, that which such Magistrate is empowered to 
inflict, or, being a Magistrate of the second class, is of opinion that the accused ought to be required to e xecute a 
bond under section 106, he may record the opinion and submit his proceedings, and forward the accused, to the 
Chief Judicial Magistrate to whom he is subordinate.

another. —(1) Whenever any 1[Judge or Magistrate], after having heard and recorded the whole or any part of the 
evidence in any enquiry o r a trial, ceases to exercise jurisdiction therein and is succeeded by another 1[Judge or 
Magistrate] who has and who exercises such jurisdiction, the 1[Judge or Magistrate] so succeeding may act on the 
evidence so recorded by his predecessor, or partly re corded by his predecessor and partly recorded by himself:  
Provided that if the succeeding 1[Judge or Magistrate] is of opinion that further examination of any of the 
witnesses whose evidence has already been recorded is necessary in the interests of Justic e, he may re -summon any

the witness shall be discharged.

other person who may be in possession of the property:
