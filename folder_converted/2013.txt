1. Subs. by Act 31 of 2016, s. 255 and the Eleventh Schedule, for section 326 (w.e.f . 15-11-2016).  178

The value of the security of a secured creditor of a company is Rs. 1,00,000. The total amount of the workmen's 
dues is Rs. 1,00,000. The amount of the debts due from the company to its secur ed creditors is Rs.3,00,000. The

the creditors of the company or a surety or guarantor for any of the debts or other liabilities of the 
company, and the company does anything or suffers any thing done which has the effect of putting that

position he would have been in if that thing had not been done prior to six months of making winding u p 
application, the Tribunal, if satisfied that, such transaction is a fraudulent preference may order as it may 
think fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if the company had not given that 
preference.

the person preferred shall be subject to the same liabilities, and shall have the same rights, as if he had

necessary so to do for the purposes of the winding up, and for that purpose, may give leave to bring in the 
surety or guarantor as a third party as in the case of a suit for the recovery of t he sum paid.

par and at such time as they may from time to time think fit.  
2. (i) Every person whose name is entered as a member in the register of members shall be enti tled to

(ii) To every such separate meeting, the provisions of these regulations relating to general  meetings 
shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be at least two persons holding at 
least one -third of the issued shares of the class in question.  
7. The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with  preferred or other 
rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, be 
deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu therewith.  
8. Subject to the provisions of sec tion 55, any preference shares may, with the sanction of an ordinary

Provided that the Board of directors may at any time declare any share to be wholly or in part

the registered holder for the time being of the share or the person entitled thereto by reason of his 
death or insolvency.  
11. (i) To give effect to any such sale, the Bo ard may authorise some person to transfer the shares 
sold to the purchaser thereof.  
(ii) The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares comprised in any such transfer.

unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way of premium) and 
not by the conditions of allotment thereof made payable at fixed times:  
Provided that no call shall exceed one -fourth of the nominal value of the share or be payable at less 
than one month from the date fixed for the payment of the last preceding call.  
(ii) Each member shall, subject to rec eiving at least fourteen days’ notice specifying the time or times 
and place of payment, pay to the company, at the time or times and place so specified, the amount called 
on his shares.  
(iii) A call may be revoked or postponed at the discretion of the Boa rd.

16. (i) If a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment

payment thereof to the time of actual payment at ten per cent. per annum or at such lower rate, if any, as 
the Board may determine.  
(ii) The Board shall be at liberty to waive payment of any such interest wholly or in part.  
17. (i) Any sum which by the terms of issue of a share becomes payable on allotment or at any fixed 
date, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, shall, for the purposes 
of these regulations, be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which by the terms of 
issue such  sum becomes payable.  
(ii) In case of non -payment of such sum, all the relevant provisions of these regulations as to payment 
of interest and expenses, forfeiture or otherwise shall apply as if such sum had become payable by virtue 
of a call duly made and notified.  
18. The Board — 
(a) may, if it thinks fit, receive from any member willing to advance the same, all or any part of 
the monies uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him; and  
(b) upon all or any of the monies so advanced, may (until the same w ould, but for such advance, 
become presently payable) pay interest at such rate not exceeding, unless the company in general 
meeting shall otherwise direct, twelve per cent. per annum, as may be agreed upon between the Board 
and the member paying the sum i n advance.  
Transfer of shares  
19. (i) The instrument of transfer of any share in the company shall be executed by or on behalf of

section 56;

and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to 
make the transfer; and  
(c) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares.  
22. On giving not less than seven days’ previous notice in accordance with section 91and rules made 
thereunder, the registration of transfers may be suspended at such times and for such periods as the Board 
may from time to time determine:  
Provided that such registration shall not be suspended for more than thirty days at any one time or for 
more than forty -five days in the aggregate in any year.  
Transmission of shares  
23. (i) On the death of a member, the survivor or  survivors where the member was a joint holder, and 
his nominee or nominees or legal representatives where he was a sole holder, shall be the only persons 
recognised by the company as having any title to his interest in the shares.  
(ii) Nothing in clause ( i) shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect 
of any share which had been jointly held by him with other persons.  
24. (i) Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or insolvency of a 
member m ay, upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time properly be required by the 
Board and subject as hereinafter provided, elect, either — 
(a) to be registered himself as holder of the share; or  
(b) to make such transfer of the share as the decea sed or insolvent member could have made.  
(ii) The Board shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as it would 
have had, if the deceased or insolvent member had transferred the share before his death or insolvency.  
25. (i) If the person so becoming entitled shall elect to be registered as holder of the share himself, he 
shall deliver or send to the company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects.  
(ii) If the person aforesaid shall elect to transfer the share, he shall testify his election by executing a 
transfer of the share.  
(iii) All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these regulations relating to the right to transfer 
and the registration of transfers of shares shall be applicable to any such notice or transfer as aforesaid as 
if the death or insolvency of the member had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed 
by that member.  
26. A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or insolvency of the holder  shall be 
entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would been titled if he were the 
registered holder of the share, except that he shall not, before being registered as a member in respect of 
the share, be entitled in respect of it t o exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to meetings

 SCHEDULE II  
(See section 123)  
USEFUL LIVES TO COMPUTE DEPRECIATION  
PART ‘A’  
1. Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. 
The depreciable amount of an asset is the cost of an asset or other amount substituted  for cost, less its 
residual value. The useful life of an asset is the period over which an asset is expected to be available for 
use by an entity, or the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by 
the entity.  
2. For th e purpose of this Schedule, the term depreciation includes amortisation.  
3. Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of paragraph 1, — 
1[(i) The useful life of an asset shall not ordinarily be different from the useful life specified in 
Part C and the residual value of an asset shall not be more than five per cent. of the original cost of 
the asset:  
Provided that where a company adopts a useful life different from what is specified in Part C or 
uses a residual value different from the limit specified ab ove, the financial statements shall disclose 
such difference and provide justification in this behalf duly supported by technical advice.]  
2[(ii) 3[For intangible assets, the relevant Indian Accounting Standards (Ind As) shall apply. Where 
a company is not  required to comply with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind As), it shall comply 
with relevant Accounting Standards under Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006] except in 
case of intangible assets (Toll Roads) created under 'Build, Operate and Tra nsfer', 'Build, Own, 
Operate and Transfer' or any other form of public private partnership route in case of road projects. 
Amortisation in such cases may be done as follows: — 
(a) Mode of amortization  
 
Amortisation Rate =  
Amortisation Amount=  
    Cost of I ntangible Assets (A) x    
       Amorisation Amount  
 
 
 x 100  Cost of Intangible Assets (A)  
Actual Revenue for the year (B)   
Projected  Revenue from Intangible Asset 
(till the end of the concession period) (C ) 
  
 
(b) Meaning of particulars are as fo llows : — 
Cost of Intangible Assets (A)  = Cost incurred by the company in accordance with 
the accounting standards.  
Actual Revenue for the year (13)  = Actual revenue (Toll Charges) received during the 
accounting year.  
Projected Revenue from Intangible 
Asset (C)   Total projected revenue from the Intangible Assets 
as provided to the project lender at the time of 
financial closure/agreement.  
The amortisation amount or rate should ensure that the whole of the cost of the intangible asset is 
amortised over the  concession period.  
                                                           
1. Subs. by  Notification No. G.S.R. 627(E) dated 29th August  2014 , for sub -paragraph ( i) of paragraph 3  (w.e.f. 29 -8-2014).  
2. Subs. by Notification No. G.S.R. 237(E), dated 31st  March  2014, for sub -paragraph ( i) to ( iii) of paragraph 3(w.e.f. 1 -4-2014).  
3. Subs. by Notification No. G.S. R. 1075(E), dated 17th November  2016  for sub-paragraph ( iii) of paragraph 3  (w.e.f. 1 -4-2016).  249 
 Revenue shall be reviewed at the end of each financial year and projected revenue shall be adjusted 
to reflect such changes, if any, in the estimates as will lead to the actual collection at the end of the 
concession period.  
 
(c) Exampl e:— 
Cost of creation of Intangible Assets                   :  Rs. 500 Crores  
Total period of Agreement                                   :  20 Years  
Time used for creation of Intangible Assets        :  2 Years  
Intangible Assets to be amortised in                    : 18 Years  
Assuming that the Total revenue to be generated out of Intangible Assets over the period 
would be Rs. 600 Crores, in the following manner: — 
Year No.  Revenue( In Rs. Crores)  Remarks  
Year 1  5 Actual   
Year 2  7.5 Estimate *  
Year 3  10 Estimate *  
Year 4  12.5 Estimate *  
Year 5  17.5 Estimate *  
Year 6  20 Estimate *  
Year 7  23 Estimate *  
Year 8  27 Estimate *  
Year 9  31 Estimate *  
Year 10  34 Estimate *  
Year 11  38 Estimate *  
Year 12  41 Estimate *  
Year 13  46 Estimate *  
Year 14  50 Estimate  * 
Year 15  53 Estimate *  
Year 16  57 Estimate *  
Year 17  60 Estimate*  
Year 18  67.5 Estimate *  
Total  600  
 
‘*’ will be actual at the end of financial year.  
Based on this the charge for first year would be Rs. 4.16 Crore (approximately) ( i.e. Rs. 5/Rs. 6 00 x 
Rs. 500 Crores) which would be charged to profit and loss and 0.83% ( i.e. Rs. 4.16 Crore/ Rs. 500 
Crore x 100) is the amortisation rate for the first year.  
Where a company arrives at the amortisation amount in respect of the said Intangible Assets in 
accordance with any method as per the applicable Accounting Standards, it shall disclose the same.]  
PART ‘B’  
4. The useful life or residual value of any specific asset, as notified for accounting purposes by a 
Regulatory Authority constituted under an Act of Parliament or by the Central Government shall be 
applied in calculating the depreciation to be provided for such asset irrespective of the requirements of 
this Schedule.
