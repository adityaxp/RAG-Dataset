transfer, then, the relevant shipping income under this secti on shall be computed as if the transfer, in 
either case, had been made at the market value of such goods or services as on that date:  
Provided  that where, in the opinion of the Assessing Officer, the computation of the relevant shipping

services, means the price that such goods or services would ordinarily fetch on sale in the open market.  
(8) Where it appears to the Assessing Officer that, owing to the close connection between the tonnage 
tax company and any other person, or for any other reason, the course of business between them is so 
arranged that the business transacted between them produces to the tonnage tax company more than the 
ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in the tonnage tax business, the Assessing Officer shall, 
in co mputing the relevant shipping income of the tonnage tax company for the purposes of this Chapter, 
take the amount of income as may reasonably be deemed to have been derived therefrom.

business and other business on a fair proportion to be determined by the Assessing Officer, having regard 
to the use of such asset for the purpose of the tonnage tax business and for the other b usiness.  
115VK.  Depreciation. —(1) For the purposes of computing depreciation under clause ( iv) of  
section 115VL, the depreciation for the first previous year of the tonnage tax scheme (hereafter in this 
section referred to as the first previous year) shal l be computed on the written down value of the 
qualifying ships as specified under sub -section ( 2).

year, shall be divided in the ratio of the book wr itten down value of the qualifying ships (hereafter in this 
section referred to as the qualifying assets) and the book written down value of the non -qualifying ships 
(hereafter in this section referred to as the other assets).  
(3) The block of qualifying a ssets as determined under sub -section ( 2) shall constitute a separate 
block of assets for the purposes of this Chapter.  509 (4) For  the purposes of sub -section ( 2), the book written down value of the block of qualifying assets 
and the block of other assets sha ll be computed in the following manner, namely: — 
(a)  the book written down value of each qualifying asset and each other asset as on the first day 
of the previous year and which form part of the block of assets to be divided shall be determined by 
taking the book written down value of each asset appearing in the books of account as on the last day 
of the preceding previous year:  
Provided  that any change in the value of the assets consequent to their revaluation after the date 
on which the Finance (No. 2) A ct, 2004 receives the assent of the President shall be ignored;  
(b)  the book written down value of all the qualifying assets and other assets shall be aggregated; 
and 
(c)  the ratio of the aggregate book written down value of the qualifying assets to the aggregate 
book written down value of the other assets shall be determined.  
(5) Where an asset forming part of a block of qualifying assets begins to be used for purposes other 
than the tonnage tax business, an appropriate portion of the written down value allocable to such asset 
shall be reduced from the written down value of that block and shall be added to the block of other assets.  
Explanation. —For the purposes of this sub -section, appropriate portion of the written down value 
allocable to the asset, whi ch begins to be used for purposes other than the tonnage tax business, shall be 
an amount which bears the same proportion to the written down value of the block of qualifying assets as 
on the first day of the previous year as the book written down value of  the asset beginning to be used for 
purposes other than tonnage tax business bears to the book written down value of all the assets forming 
the block of qualifying asset.  
(6) Where an asset forming part of a block of other assets begins to be used for tonn age tax business, 
an appropriate portion of the written down value allocable to such asset shall be reduced from the written 
down value of the block of other assets and shall be added to the block of qualifying asset.  
Explanation. —For the purposes of this sub-section, appropriate portion of written down value 
allocable to the asset which begins to be used for the tonnage tax business shall be an amount which bears 
the same proportion to the written down value of the block of other assets as on the first day  of the 
previous year as the book written down value of the asset beginning to be used for tonnage tax business 
bears to the total book written down value of all the assets forming the block of other assets.  
(7) For the purposes of computing depreciation u nder clause ( iv) of section 115VL in respect of an 
asset mentioned in sub -sections ( 5) and ( 6), depreciation computed for the previous year shall be 
allocated in the ratio of the number of days for which the asset was used for the tonnage tax business and 
for purposes other than tonnage tax business.  
Explanation 1. —For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that for the purposes of this Act, 
depreciation on the block of qualifying assets and block of other assets so created shall be allowed as if
